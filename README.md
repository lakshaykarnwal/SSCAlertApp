# SSC Alert app

## Inspiration
How many have we seen students (especially first year students) struggling to find vacancy in their course of choice. When the seats are full, the only solution is to keep checking the seat availability every day in order to book the seat as soon as there is a vacancy.

As a student who has been in a similar situation for multiple courses, my team members (Zack Hamza, Nafiz Anjoom, Ravino Juwono) and I were insipired to create an application which could makes this process hassle free and save students some a lot of time. 

## What it does
To tackle this problem we created a Java Application which notifies students of a vacancy in their course as soon as there is one.

## How we built it
We used several APIs to build this project. For example, we used Jsoup to parse the website and record the number of seats available every few seconds. We used the Javax.Mail API to send an email to our email inbox.

## What's next for SSCAlert
We plan to expand its features. For example, we plan to send text to phones, develop it into an app, and host it on a webserver.
